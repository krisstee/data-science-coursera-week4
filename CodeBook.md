SUMMARY: The purpose of this data collection was to reflect changes requested
from the Week 4 Assignment of the Getting and Cleaning Data course from
Coursera. The data contains the averages of each variable for each activity
from the UCI Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set. Further
